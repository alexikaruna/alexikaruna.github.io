Notes on how I installed this so I can remember:

- remote theme used in _config.yml
    forked the tactile repo and using my repos version but still remote
- added assets/css/style.css for any style overrides in css
- added _includes to override favicon, etc (have not done yet)
- added _layouts/default.html and copied the layout from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pages-themes/tactile/master/_layouts/default.html
    so we can override things
    also added head-custom.html there which is where the favicon is set
